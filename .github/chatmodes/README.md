# Chatmodes: MR Review

This folder contains resources to run an AI-powered Merge Request / Pull Request reviewer.

Files
- `Review proposed mr.chatmode.md` — the full system prompt and integrated Code Review & Refactoring Cheat Sheet. Use this as the assistant's system message.
- `cheatsheet.md` — a human-friendly Markdown version of the cheat sheet for quick reference.
- `variants.md` — concise prompt variants (concise, security-first, fast-triage, patch-suggest) you can use to change the review lens.
- `../workflows/mr-review.yml` — a GitHub Actions template that demonstrates collecting diffs and calling an LLM endpoint. It's a starting point and must be customized.

Quick usage

1. Copy the contents of `Review proposed mr.chatmode.md` into your LLM system prompt field for strict, structured reviews.
2. Use `variants.md` to switch focus (e.g., security-first). You can prepend a variant to the system prompt to combine strict formatting with a focused lens.
3. Use `cheatsheet.md` during reviews or mentoring sessions — it's printable and easy to reference.

Integrating into CI

- The workflow in `.github/workflows/mr-review.yml` is a template. Customize the LLM call step to use your provider's SDK or API and set `secrets.LLM_ENDPOINT` and `secrets.LLM_API_KEY` in your repository secrets.
- Be cautious with sensitive data. Avoid sending secret keys, user data, or large diffs to third-party services without approval.
- Consider starting with the `fast-triage` variant for initial pushes, then run a full review with the main chatmode after the author narrows the scope.
